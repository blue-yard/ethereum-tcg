# Ethereum-Themed Trading Card Game — Graphics Department Brief

## Objective

Design **composable card templates** and **individual card illustrations** for all card types in the Ethereum-themed TCG. Templates must allow rapid creation of new cards within each type while maintaining visual consistency.

---

## Card Template Requirements

### General Template Guidelines

* **Consistent frame structure** for all cards: name bar, cost indicator, type label, main art area, text box, stats (if applicable).
* **Composable design system**: use layered PSD or vector files with separate layers for background, frame, text, art, and icons.
* **Space for icons**: ETH, staking, attack/defense, rarity symbols.
* **Color-coding by card type** for quick visual recognition.

## Card Type Templates

### 1. EOA 

* **Color theme**: Cool blues and metallic silvers.
* **Frame motif**: Wallets, crypto whales
* **Special frame element**: Small animated-style overlay to indicate staking risk/yield.
* **Example cards**: Crypto whale, Extra Wallet

### 2. Units ("Creatures")

* **Color theme**: Bold greens, oranges, or faction-based colors.
* **Frame motif**: Node clusters, avatars, or robotic/mechanical elements.
* **Stats area**: Lower right corner, attack/defense clearly visible.
* **Example cards**: Validator Node, Arbitrage Bot, Crypto Whale, DAO Council.

### 3. Direct Interaction (Instants/Sorceries)

* **Color theme**: Reds and aggressive accents.
* **Frame motif**: Fragmented chains, warning triangles, flashing alerts.
* **Example cards**: Rug Pull, MEV Snipe, 51% Attack.

### 4. Utility / Advantage

* **Color theme**: Light blues and golds.
* **Frame motif**: Governance halls, charts, and data visualizations.
* **Example cards**: Oracle Feed, Governance Vote, Gas Optimization.

### 5. Finishers / Big Plays

* **Color theme**: Deep purples and blacks with high-contrast highlights.
* **Frame motif**: Explosions, takeovers, or massive structures.
* **Example cards**: Flash Loan Cascade, Protocol Takeover.

### 6. Artifacts / Enchantments

* **Color theme**: Steely grays and neon accents.
* **Frame motif**: Smart contracts, bridge diagrams, liquidity graphs.
* **Example cards**: Layer 2 Bridge, Smart Contract Upgrade, DEX Liquidity Pool.

## Art Style Guide

* **Style**: Futuristic cyberpunk meets high-finance; detailed but readable at small sizes.
* **Consistency**: All art should share a unified lighting and perspective style.
* **Iconography**: Use blockchain- and finance-related symbols that are intuitive but not brand-locked.

---

## Deliverables

1. **Card template files** (one per card type, layered PSD or vector).
2. **Icon set** for ETH, staking, attack/defense, rarity, status effects.
3. **Sample set** of fully illustrated cards (at least 1 per type).
4. **Design system guide** for adding new cards easily.

---

## Notes

* The **ETH Wallet** is part of the game UI, not a card — no design needed.
* There is also **Cold Storage** as a part of the game UI. The player wins when they have 20 ETH in cold storage (which they move out of hot wallets etc)
* Templates must be adaptable for both digital and print formats.
* Ensure space for localization of text.

**Next Step for Graphics**: Produce draft templates for review, then move into individual card illustrations.
