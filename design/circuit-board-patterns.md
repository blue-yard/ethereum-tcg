## CIRCUIT BOARD DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Visual Language
The circuit board aesthetic serves as the foundation for all Token Tycoon cards, representing the interconnected nature of blockchain technology through familiar electronic component patterns. Each circuit element has meaning:

- **Traces (Lines)**: Data flow, connections between components
- **Nodes (Circles)**: Network junctions, interaction points  
- **Components (Rectangles)**: Smart contracts, protocols, applications
- **Chips (Complex shapes)**: Major platforms, chains, core infrastructure
- **Resistors/Capacitors**: Utility components, supporting functions
