- **Magenta Glow** (#FF0080 - #E6007A): Secondary accent for variety
- **Circuit Purple** (#8B00FF - #6B00CC): Tertiary for depth and richness

### Gradient Strategy
- Multi-layer gradient fills on typography (amber → orange → red)
- Subtle gradients on circuit lines creating depth
- Radial glows around key elements suggesting energy emission

---

## Typography System

### Display Type Treatment
- **Style**: Bold, geometric sans-serif with retro-gaming influence
- **Effects**: 
  - Multi-layer stroke system (3-4 layers)
  - Gradient fill from warm (top) to cool (bottom)
  - Subtle outer glow for luminescence
  - Slight perspective/isometric angle
- **Hierarchy**: 
  - Primary: Card names (largest, most prominent)
  - Secondary: Card types and costs
  - Tertiary: Description text and abilities

## Notes

* The **ETH Wallet** is part of the game UI, not a card — no design needed.
* Cold Storage is also part of the game UI. A player wins when they get the target number of ETH (e.g. 20) in cold storage or the opponent has 0 ETH or less
* Templates must be adaptable for both digital and print formats.
* Ensure space for localization of text.
* All designs maintain **Token Tycoon** branding and Cyberpunk Circuit Board consistency

**Next Step for Graphics**: Begin template file production using the comprehensive specifications provided, then move into individual card illustrations following the detailed briefs.
