# Token Tycoon v2.0 - Implementation
## Cyberpunk Circuit Board Design System

This directory contains the complete implementation of the Token Tycoon v2.0 design system with the Cyberpunk Circuit Board visual language.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Open the showcase**: Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. **Explore interactions**: Hover over cards, click them, and experience the animations
3. **Debug mode**: Add `?debug=true` to the URL for development insights
4. **Reduced motion**: The system respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### Performance Settings
```javascript
// Automatic quality detection based on device performance
// Can be manually overridden:
tokenTycoon.setQuality('high');   // Enable all effects
tokenTycoon.setQuality('standard'); // Balanced performance
tokenTycoon.setQuality('low');    // Minimal effects for low-end devices
```

### Accessibility Settings
```javascript
// Respects user preferences automatically
// Can be manually controlled:
tokenTycoon.setReducedMotion(true);  // Disable complex animations
tokenTycoon.setHighContrast(true);   // Enable high contrast mode
```

### Debug Features
```javascript
// Enable debug mode by adding ?debug=true to URL
// Shows real-time performance metrics and interaction states
```

## 🔍 Development Notes

### Adding New Cards
1. Create HTML structure following existing pattern
2. Apply appropriate card type class (`chain-card`, `defi-card`, etc.)
3. Set rarity tier class (`standard-tier`, `premium-tier`, etc.)
4. Add data attributes (`data-card-name`, `data-cost`, `data-type`)
5. Include SVG circuit pattern with appropriate animations

### Customizing Animations
1. Modify CSS custom properties for timing
2. Adjust particle system configurations in `particle-system.js`
3. Add new animation keyframes in `animations.css`
4. Update card-specific effects in `card-types.css`

### Performance Debugging
1. Enable debug mode with `?debug=true`
2. Monitor FPS and particle count in debug overlay
3. Use browser dev tools Performance tab
4. Test on various devices and connection speeds

## 📞 Integration Notes

This implementation is designed to integrate with:
- **Game Engine**: Event system ready for game state integration
- **Backend APIs**: Card data can be loaded dynamically
- **Build Systems**: CSS/JS can be processed and optimized
- **Component Frameworks**: Classes can be wrapped in React/Vue/etc.

The system provides a solid foundation for the complete Token Tycoon game implementation while maintaining the sophisticated Cyberpunk Circuit Board aesthetic throughout all interactions and states.
